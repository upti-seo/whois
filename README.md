Domain Availability Checker
Domain Availability Checker In PHP: When we create a new website, we first get its domain name. Because taking the domain name is the most needed thing in website creation. And nowadays, the get domain name you want is very difficult, because someone has already registered. For that, we check the domain name in any domain registry website, that no one has already registered this name.
